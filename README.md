# Stereovision-camera
This is the code repository that consists of the code I wrote to build a stereovision system by learning from scratch on image processing, and the fundamentals of triangulation of images to find the distance. This project is capable of 
detecting a red object within the frame, as well as its diameter estimation and the distance to the camera.
